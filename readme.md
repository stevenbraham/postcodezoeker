# Overview

This is a simple "site" that I build that allow you to find the name of Dutch county based on the postal code.

# Developing
Compiling is done trough [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix).

During development you should execute `npm run watch`. This copies everything from the source to the build folder. I recommend starting a http-server in the build folder.

If you want to create your own minified version for production, execute `npm run prod`.
