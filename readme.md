# Overview

This is a simple "site" that I build that allow you to find the name of Dutch county based on the postal code.

# Developing
**This project asumes that you have gulp *globally* installed. If this is not the case please execute the following command:** 
(*On Unix based systems you need root rights*)

`npm install -g gulp` 

During development you should execute `gulp watch`. This copies everything from the source to the build folder. I reccomend starting a http-server in the build folder.

If you want to create your own minified version for production, exectute `gulp --production`.
